# Data Quality Control and Cleanup Procedures

## Overview of Data Integrity Issues

During the data integration process, several systematic issues were identified that required standardized cleanup procedures to ensure analytical validity. These issues spanned multiple data types including cell count calculations, sample identification, and temporal data accuracy. 
The updated information was incorporated into the file "./resources/processed_data/Nasal_Biomarkers_BAL_2025-02-01.csv". 

## BAL Cell Count Calculations

### Standardized Calculation Methods
All BAL absolute eosinophil counts (AEC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were systematically calculated using:

**Formula**: `Absolute Count = (Total Nucleated Cells) × (Cell Type Percentage / 100)`

**Units**: All cell counts expressed as cells/μL

```{r bal-cell-calculations}
# Calculate BAL absolute eosinophil and neutrophil counts
phenotype <- phenotype %>%
  mutate(
    BAL_eos_ct = BAL_eos_p / 100 * BAL_wbc,
    BAL_neut_ct = BAL_neut_p / 100 * BAL_wbc
  )
```

### Quality Control for Cell Count Data
- **Cross-validation**: Percentage calculations verified against manual differential counts
- **Range validation**: Identified and flagged physiologically implausible values
- **Missing data handling**: Systematic approach for samples with incomplete differential counts

## Critical Data Corrections

### Subject-Specific Corrections

**Subject ID 66 - Blood Count Correction:**
- **Original Error**: Blood Eos % listed as 5900 (physiologically impossible)
- **Correction**: Blood WBC = 13,800; recalculated appropriate eosinophil percentage

**Subject ID 279 - Missing Eosinophil Percentage:**
- **Issue**: Blood Eos % missing despite available WBC and absolute eosinophil counts
- **Calculation**: `Eos % = (Serum Eos absolute / Serum WBC) × 100 = 7%`

### Systematic Date Corrections

**BAL/CBC Date Mismatches:**
Multiple participants had incorrect dates in the primary database that were corrected using secondary validation sources:

| Study ID | Sample Type | Original Date | Corrected Date | Source_of_Original_Date |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2 | CBC | 7/10/2015 | 5/13/2015 | BiomarkersOfAsthmaSt_DATA_LABELS_2024-03-06 |
| 9 | CBC | 7/10/2015 | 4/11/2017 | BiomarkersOfAsthmaSt_DATA_LABELS_2024-03-06 |
| 39 | CBC | 10/23/2015 | 2/6/2014 | BiomarkersOfAsthmaSt_DATA_LABELS_2024-03-06 |
| 45 | CBC | 12/4/2015 | 10/21/2013 | BiomarkersOfAsthmaSt_DATA_LABELS_2024-03-06 |
| 60 | CBC | 12/4/2015 | 11/18/2015 | BiomarkersOfAsthmaSt_DATA_LABELS_2024-03-06 |
| 110 | Bronchoscopy | 4/15/2015 | 4/15/2016 | BiomarkersOfAsthmaSt_DATA_LABELS_2024-03-06 |
| 363 | Bronchoscopy | 10/28/2019 | 10/18/2019 | BiomarkersOfAsthmaSt_DATA_LABELS_2024-03-06 |

**Validation Process:**
- **Primary source**: BiomarkersOfAsthmaSt_DATA_LABELS_2024-03-06
- **Secondary validation**: EPIC patient chart

## Missing Data Documentation

### ACT Score Completeness
**Missing ACT Scores:**
- Subject 238 (Bria Rosario, 10/9/12)
- Subject 324 (Josiah Loney, 1/31/12)

**Impact Assessment**: Missing ACT scores handled through listwise deletion in relevant analyses

### BAL Differential Count Issues

**Technical Limitations Affecting Cell Counts:**

| Subject ID | BAL lab results report description | Resolution |
|------------|-------------------|------------|
| 332 | Many degenerated cells present, unable to perform differential | Excluded from differential count analyses |
| 334 | BAL differential available | BAL count updated in the phenotype data file |
| 366 | Manual differential not performed due to cell degeneration | Excluded from differential count analyses |
| 368 | Many degenerated cells, differential unreliable, many eosinophils noted | Qualitative notation preserved, quantitative analysis excluded |
| 373 | BAL differential available, though some cell degeneration noted | BAL count updated in the phenotype data file |

- **Primary source**: EPIC patient chart



# Data Processing

## Phenotype Data Preparation

The phenotype data preparation involved integrating biomarker measurements, batch information, and clinical parameters to create a comprehensive dataset for downstream analysis.

### Data Integration and Feature Engineering

We combined processed nasal biomarker file with the BAL phenotype file. Key transformations included:

- **BAL Cell Count Calculation**: Absolute eosinophil and neutrophil counts were calculated from BAL white blood cell counts and respective percentages:
  - `BAL_eos_ct = BAL_eos_p / 100 × BAL_wbc`
  - `BAL_neut_ct = BAL_neut_p / 100 × BAL_wbc`

- **Eosinophil Phenotype Classification**: Samples were classified based on BAL eosinophil percentage with a 1% threshold:
  - High eosinophil (>1% BAL eosinophils)
  - Low eosinophil (≤1% BAL eosinophils)

- **Log Transformation**: All cell count and biomarker variables underwent log10 transformation with a small constant (0.001) to handle zero values and achieve normal distribution.

- **Data Standardization**: Log-transformed variables were centered and scaled (z-score normalization) to enable comparison across different measurement scales.


```{r data-processing, eval=FALSE}
# This code is run separately in src/data_processing/
source("src/data_processing/making_phenotype_dataframe_with_batch_asthma_phenotype_cell_count.R")
```

## Gene Expression Data Normalization

RNA-seq gene count data underwent variance stabilizing transformation (VST) using DESeq2 to prepare normalized expression matrices suitable for downstream analysis.

### Normalization Workflow

The normalization process included several key steps:

1. **Sample Filtering**: Samples were filtered based on BAL cell count availability (BAL_eos_p ≥ 0 and BAL_neut_p ≥ 0)

2. **Inflammatory Phenotype Classification**: two models were trialed. 
2-1. 'comp1': inflammatory phenotypes based on BAL eosinophil and neutrophil percentages:
   - **Paucicellular**: ≤1% eosinophils and ≤4% neutrophils
   - **Eosinophilic**: >1% eosinophils and ≤4% neutrophils  
   - **Neutrophilic**: ≤1% eosinophils and >4% neutrophils
   - **Mixed**: >1% eosinophils and >4% neutrophils
2-2. 'comp2': inflammatory phenotypes based on BAL eosinophil percentages only:
   - **Eosinophilic**: >1% eosinophils and ≤1% eosinophils  

3. **Low Count Gene Filtering**: Genes with fewer than 10 counts in the smallest group size were removed to improve statistical power

4. **Variance Stabilizing Transformation**: VST was applied using DESeq2 with a design formula. The count normalization that was used for  `~ comp2 + Batch` to account for both biological groups and technical batch effects

### Batch Effect Correction

Two versions of normalized data were generated:

- **Without batch correction**: Preserving natural batch-to-batch variation
- **With batch correction**: Using limma's `removeBatchEffect()` function to remove technical batch variation while preserving biological group differences

The batch correction was applied using the model matrix `~ comp2` to ensure that biological differences between high and low eosinophil groups were preserved during batch effect removal.

```{r gene-normalization, eval=FALSE}
# This code is run separately in src/data_processing/
source("src/data_processing/scaled_gene_count_DESeq_vsd.R")
```

### Quality Control Assessment

Normalization quality was assessed through:
- **Mean-variance relationship plots**: Confirming successful variance stabilization
- **Sample distance heatmaps**: Visualizing batch clustering patterns
- **Principal component analysis**: Evaluating separation by biological groups and batch effects

Both bronchial and nasal samples were processed separately using identical normalization parameters to ensure consistency across tissue types.

## Output Files

The data processing pipeline generates several key output files:

- **Phenotype data**: `scaled_phenotype_studyID_asthmaPhenotype_batch_cellCount_[DATE].csv`
- **Normalized gene counts**: 
  - Bronchial samples: `normalized_gene_count_bronch_vsd_[batch-correction-status]_[DATE].txt`
  - Nasal samples: `normalized_gene_count_nasal_vsd_[batch-correction-status]_[DATE].txt`
- **Parameter documentation**: `normalization_parameters_[DATE].txt`

These processed datasets serve as the foundation for all subsequent differential expression analyses and biological interpretation.


# Phenotype Characterization

## Cohort Description and Clinical Characteristics

The phenotype characterization involved comprehensive analysis of clinical variables, biomarker concordance, and their associations with gene expression patterns through dimensional reduction techniques.

library(FactoMineR)
library(limma)
library(Glimma)
library(edgeR)

library(RColorBrewer)
library(vsn)
```

### Study Population Summary

Clinical and demographic characteristics were summarized for the entire cohort and stratified by BAL eosinophil levels (>1% threshold). Key variables included demographics, asthma control measures, exacerbation history, medication usage, and airway inflammatory profiles.

```{r phenotype-summary}
# Generate comprehensive phenotype summary
source("src/data_vis_exploration/phenotype_summary.R")
```

**Cohort Demographics and Clinical Features:**
- Total participants with RNA-seq data: n = 70 bronchial samples
- Age distribution, sex, race, and ethnicity breakdown
- Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores and lung function parameters
- Healthcare utilization: Emergency department visits and hospitalizations
- Current medication regimens

### BAL and Blood Eosinophil Concordance Analysis

We performed comprehensive concordance analysis between BAL and peripheral blood eosinophil measurements to evaluate the relationship between systemic and airway eosinophilia.

```{r eosinophil-concordance, fig.width=7.09, fig.height=7.09, dpi=600}
# Run comprehensive concordance analysis
source("src/data_vis_exploration/concordance_bal_eos_blood_eos.R")
```

**Key Concordance Metrics:**
- **Pearson correlation** between BAL and blood eosinophils (raw and log-transformed values)
- **Spearman correlation** for non-parametric association
- **Cohen's kappa** for categorical agreement (high vs. normal)
- **Diagnostic performance metrics**: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values

### Bidirectional Diagnostic Performance

The analysis included bidirectional assessment of predictive performance:

1. **BAL → Blood**: Using BAL eosinophil percentage to predict high blood eosinophils
2. **Blood → BAL**: Using blood eosinophil count to predict high BAL eosinophils

```{r roc-analysis, fig.width=7.09, fig.height=7.09, dpi=600}
# ROC curves and optimal cutoff determination will be generated
# within the concordance analysis script
```

### Inter-Cell Count Correlation Analysis

Extended correlation analysis examined relationships between multiple inflammatory cell populations in both BAL and blood compartments.

```{r inter-cell-correlation, fig.width=7.09, fig.height=7.09, dpi=600}
# Run inter-cellular correlation analysis
# The analysis was limited to samples for which the time differences between blood and BAL sampling were < 30 days:

source("src/data_vis_exploration/correlation_inter_cell-count.R")
```

**Cell Population Relationships:**
- BAL eosinophils, neutrophils, and total white blood cells
- Blood eosinophils, neutrophils, and total white blood cells
- Cross-compartment correlations between airway and systemic inflammation
- Impact of sampling date differences on concordance

### Medication Effects on Eosinophil Levels

Systematic analysis of medication effects on both BAL and blood eosinophil levels included:

- **Controller medications**: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta agonists (LABA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTR)
- **Reliever medications**: Short-acting beta agonists (SABA)
- **Biologic therapies**: Anti-IgE and anti-IL5 treatments where applicable

Statistical comparisons used t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square/Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.


## Gene Expression Pattern Analysis

### Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) Analysis

We performed MDS analysis to identify the primary sources of variation in gene expression and their associations with clinical phenotypes.

```{r mds-analysis, fig.width=7.09, fig.height=7.09, dpi=600}
# Comprehensive MDS analysis with phenotype associations
source("src/data_vis_exploration/mds-nasal-bronchial_rnaseq_corr-with-phenotype.R")
```

### Variance Component Analysis

MDS analysis was conducted separately for:

1. **Batch-corrected data**: Removed technical batch effects while preserving biological variation
2. **Non-batch-corrected data**: Retained all sources of variation for comparison

**Key Associations Evaluated:**
- **Technical factors**: Sequencing batch, sample type (nasal vs. bronchial)
- **Demographics**: Age, sex, race, ethnicity
- **Clinical variables**: Asthma control, lung function, exacerbation history
- **Inflammatory markers**: BAL and blood eosinophil levels (continuous and categorical)

### Statistical Methods for Association Testing

For each MDS component, we calculated:

- **Continuous variables**: Pearson correlation coefficients
- **Categorical variables**: Effect sizes (eta-squared) from ANOVA
- **Multiple testing correction**: False discovery rate (FDR) adjustment
- **Significance threshold**: Adjusted p-value < 0.05

based on the results, the batch effect was attributed with the most variability. Based on the results of MDS analysis, the most sensibile model to use in DEG analysis was DEG ~ cell count + Batch 

# Differential Expression Gene Analysis

## Overview of DEG Analysis Framework

We performed comprehensive differential expression analysis to identify genes associated with airway and systemic inflammatory cell populations in asthma. The analysis employed DESeq2 methodology with systematic evaluation of multiple inflammatory markers and thresholds.

```{r deg-setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(DESeq2)
```

## Analytical Strategy

### Study Design and Sample Selection

The differential expression analysis focused on **bronchial RNA-seq samples** to investigate lower airway transcriptomic responses associated with inflammatory cell populations. Sample selection criteria included:

- **Bronchial samples only**: RNA-seq from BAL cell pellets representing lower airway inflammation
- **Complete cell count data**: Samples with available BAL eosinophil and neutrophil measurements (BAL_eos_p ≥ 0 and BAL_neut_p ≥ 0)
- **Quality control passed**: Samples meeting RNA-seq quality metrics from batch 1-6 processing

```{r load-deg-functions}
# Load custom DEG analysis functions
source("./src/function/deg_custom_functions_v2.R")
```

### Inflammatory Phenotype Variables

We systematically evaluated associations between gene expression and inflammatory markers using both **continuous** and **categorical** approaches:

**Continuous Variables (Log-transformed and scaled):**
- **BAL inflammatory markers**: Eosinophil count/percentage, neutrophil count/percentage, total white blood cell count
- **Blood inflammatory markers**: Eosinophil count/percentage, neutrophil count/percentage, total white blood cell count

**Categorical Variables (Dichotomous thresholds):**

*BAL Eosinophil Thresholds:*
- \>0, \>1, \>3 cells/μL (absolute count)
- \>0%, \>1%, \>3% (percentage)

*BAL Neutrophil Thresholds:*
- \>0, \>5, \>13 cells/μL (absolute count)  
- \>0%, \>2%, \>5% (percentage)

*Blood Eosinophil Thresholds:*
- \>0, \>100, \>300, \>500 cells/μL (absolute count)

### Statistical Model Design

**DESeq2 Design Formula:**
```
~ [inflammatory_marker] + Batch
```

**Model Components:**
