# scRNA-seq analysis of data from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE214865
#  # The OSA group consisted of 11 patients who were polysomnographically diagnosed with OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) >5 events/hour sleep). 
#  # The Control group consisted of 11 asymptomatic individuals without OSA (AHI < 1 events/hour sleep). 
#  # Participants were recruited from individuals undergoing PSG due to suspected OSA at the Pediatic Sleep Clinics at the University of Missouri. 
#  # Inclusion criteria were 2-16 years of age; male and female, all ethnic groups and all BMIs. 
#  # Exclusion criteria were individuals younger than 2 years and older than 16 years of age, presence of genetic disorders: 
#  # cerebral palsy, neuromuscular diseases, genetic or any underlying systemic congenital disease.
# Goal: use the cell labels from this data as an input in CibersortX to deconvolute PBMC of severe asthmatic patients
